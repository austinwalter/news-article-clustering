WITH ENTITY MANIPULATION:
96.2% of non-PERSON ents occur in at least one other cluster. 
52.1% of PERSON ents occur in at least one other cluster.


Average of 51.832 PERSONs per cluster
Average of 64.94 non-PERSONs per cluster

1795 PERSON tags only appear once.
6.9% of all PERSON tags are not helpful in determining cluster boundaries.

Non-People entities occured 6,554 more times than people entities.
