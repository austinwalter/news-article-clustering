# newsfeed-nlp

## Abstract 
This unsupervised learning project allows the average news consumer to experience a stream-lined information acquisition process, free of any useless repetition. Working in Python and using a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news) of 85,000 news articles, we extract significance from the texts by utilizing a modified TFIDF-vectorizer to pre-process the data. We experiment with various clustering techniques (Kmeans, HAC, and KNN), paired with various success metrics to gauge effectiveness of the news consolidation. Visualizations are created using Seaborn and Matplotlib, along with D3 for ease of exploration. Spacy is used as the primary NLP.

## Motivation
In a political climate of intensely polarizing takes on the latest scandals, international relations, and national issues, it can be difficult to make sense of all the data. With the rise of social media, the ability to publish has been democratized and repetition in the newsfeed runs rampant. By grouping together news stories by topic, not only is the newsfeed browsing process streamlined, but groups created that provide differing perspective on the same story.

The orginal dataset was cleansed to only keep rows which contained both a url and a date. This data cleansing resulted in a working dataframe of 82,920 articles.

# Methodology - Analysis
We began by exploring the distribution of certain notable factors of the data, such as date and publisher. There are 10 unique pulishers in our subset of the data, with an interesting distribution in publishing date:

![Date Disitribution](/Visualizations/date_frequency.png)

For the purpose of our project, a document similarity-based task, it seemed most appropriate to run our clustering tests on a section of the data found to the right. Considering that the texts we are working with are all news stories, the frequency of having multiple distinct news stories published about the same event is increased when they are more chronologically compact, i.e. the chance of having an article about the 2016 Iowa Caucus 7 months after it took place is unlikely. 

We began by labelling each datapoint with a succinct event label to accurately describe the event it portrayed. One such example is found below, which yielded the label "daallo_airlines_explosion."

| daallo_airlines_explosion |  | MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) ‚Äî An explosion that blew a hole in a jetliner shortly after takeoff and left one man missing was believed to have been caused by a bomb, the pilot said Wednesday, describing how the crew calmed frightened passengers as smoke enveloped the cabin before he brought the plane back to Mogadishu‚Äôs airport for an emergency landing. Residents of Balad, a town 30 kilometers (about 18 miles) north of Mogadishu, found the body of a man who might have been blown out of the Airbus 321 in Tuesday‚Äôs blast, said police officer Mohamed Hassan. Abdiwahid Omar, the director of Somalia‚Äôs civil aviation authority, told Radio Mogadishu that authorities were not sure if the body was the missing passenger. Government officials also said no evidence had been found so far of a criminal act. Mohammed Ibrahim Yassin, CEO of Daallo Airlines, did not rule out that a bomb planted on the aircraft was responsible. ‚ÄùAt this stage, everything is possible. We cannot rule out anything at this stage,‚Äù Yassin told The Associated Press. No group claimed responsibility for the blast. Somalia faces an insurgency from the Islamic extremist group which has carried out many deadly attacks across the nation. Capt. Vlatko Vodopivec, the pilot, said he and others were told the explosion was caused by a bomb. ‚ÄùIt was my first bomb I hope it will be the last,‚Äù Vodopivec told the AP by phone from Mogadishu. He said the blast happened when the plane was at around 11, 000 feet (3, 350 meters) and still climbing to its cruising altitude of 30, 000 feet. ‚ÄùIt would have been much worse if we were higher,‚Äù he added. Had the blast occurred at a higher altitude, it could have led to explosive decompression on the plane, which might have caused more severe structural damage, and would have forced a more rapid descent because of limited supplies of oxygen to the passengers. Daallo Airlines said all passengers except one got off the plane safely. It previously said the plane, which was headed to Djibouti in the Horn of Africa, carried 74 passengers. | 2/3/16 | 95647 | 2 | Talking Points Memo | Flight Lands Safely After Suspected Bomb Blew Hole In Plane | https://web.archive.org/web/20160204014156/http://talkingpointsmemo.com/world-news/daallo-airlines-explosion-plane-lands-safely | 2016 | 


This labelling was completed for 1,000 of the articles, to be used for our clustering and success metrics. 

## Defining Success

### (F1 Score) [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html]
The F1 score is defined as the harmonic mean between precision and recall. Being as this is an unsupervised learning project, the definition of "y_true" was not inherently obvious. When looking at a cluster of, say, {'zika_std': 1, 'robert_finicum_shooting': 3}, it is difficult from the mere labels which event is a false positive. In response to this ambiguity, a success algorithm was made to assign as many clusters as possible to one unique, predominant event. 

This predominant event was found by invoking not only the frequency of events, but the individual events' "ratio" when compared to the total occurences of that event. First, the predominant event was defined merely as that event which occured most often within a specific cluster. For example, in the instance of *Cluster A* containing {'zika_std': 1, 'robert_finicum_shooting': 3}, the predominant event would be 'robert_finicum_shooting.'

Second, the ratio of an event is invoked. The process of defining predominance merely by quantity of events results in doubling-up of events; multiple clusters are assigned the same event. If *Cluster B* yields {'santorum_drops_out': 1, 'robert_finicum_shooting': 2}, it would also recieve 'robert_finicum_shooting' as the predominant label. But perhaps the label "santorum_drops_out" is used only 4 times across the whole dataset, while the label "robert_finicum_shooting" was used a total of 10 times. To compare the ratio of santorum_drops_out (1/4 = .25) and robert_finicum_shooting (2/10 = .2), the label santorum_drops_out would be more significant in this particular cluster. 

If, between two clusters there is a tie in ratios of their predominant event, the clusters are dismissed when calculating the F1 Score. For our purposes, the F1 Score is not intended to be a perfect measure, but merely a gauge by which some improvement may be noticed as we pass through different clustering models.

### (Silhouette Score) [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html]
While the F1 Score defines success based on the values being assigned, the Silhouette Score uses the intrinsic properties of the clusters themselves, with no weight given to the meaning of labels. 

A value of +1 indicates that the sample is far away from its neighboring cluster and very close to the cluster its assigned. Similarly, value of -1 indicates that the point is close to its neighboring cluster than to the cluster its assigned. And, a value of 0 means its at the boundary of the distance between the two cluster. Value of +1 is ideal and -1 is least preferred. Hence, higher the value better is the cluster configuration.




Possible Roadblocks:
* Specificity in clusters. Russia = Russian election hacking or Russian international relations or Russian Olympic ban?
* Intersections in broad topics. E.g. "Donald Trump speaks about Hurricane Matthew" about DT or hurricane?


Notes:
* Put special emphasis on dates and names when organizing clusters (use spacy entity recognition)
